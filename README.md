Drawing a triangle by #  <#Title#>
In order to test what metal 2 can do, 

My original intention was the followings:
    1. 1st branch I can go is by the most primitive one: CAMetalLayer
    2. 2nd branch I can go is by MTKView

However, I could not create two branches through source control, for I didn't know how to do it.
